#Pokemon API Project

Welcome to Pokedex..!

Choose and select your Pokemon and see its details..!

This is my Pokemon API Project, filled with promises, async/await, props, mapping, filters, and all the javascript you can have. Or should we say JSX. Growing up I
loved watching pokemon so this project was a lot of fun for me. Not only was it a learning experience but I also got to build something awesome.
